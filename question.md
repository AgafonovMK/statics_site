# Questions for Developers

To complete and refine the documentation and ensure safe and optimal usage, the following clarifications are needed:

## General Design
1. Is the LockFreeQueue design intended strictly for single-producer, single-consumer usage? Can this be extended to multiple producers or consumers safely?

2. Is there a need or plan for dynamically resizing the queue or allocator pool?

3. Should the AlignedAllocator be thread-safe or is the design intended to rely on external synchronization?

## AlignedAllocator
1. What are the typical alignment requirements expected in production use cases? Why was 64 chosen?

2. Should memory reuse be enforced using reset() or is the allocator expected to live through the entire application lifetime?

## LogEntry
1. Why is the message buffer fixed at 256 characters? Is truncation acceptable in production scenarios?

2. Would storing timestamps as integers (e.g., milliseconds since epoch) improve performance or memory layout?

## LogBuffer
1. Is the mutex guarding allocation meant to eventually be removed (e.g., with a thread-safe allocator)?

2. Could batching or deferred allocation improve performance in high-frequency logging scenarios?

## LogWriter
1. Is log rotation or file size management planned for the output stream?

2. Is it acceptable for LogWriter to silently drop logs during shutdown if entries remain in the queue?

3. Would it be useful to allow configurable formatting (e.g., JSON logs)?

## Testing and Portability
1. Has the code been validated on platforms other than Linux? Are there plans to support Windows where posix_memalign is unavailable?

2. Are there any memory leak detection tools or benchmarks in place to test allocator and queue behavior under pressure?
